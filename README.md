2. I would like for my footer to always remain at the bottom of my website.


My goal for my next coding session
1. I would like the header and the footer to only appear at the top of the page
2. I would like to be able to scroll through my content

3. I would like for my sidebars to remain in place and retain their ratio

Specs For Sidebars

1. On my sidebar I would my sidebar image to always be as tall as the webpage itself.
2. I would like for the sidebar to always retain its width ratio depending on the percentage of space that it is taking up in reference to the main content.
3. I would like the image in the sidebar to not squish its resolution but rather push parts of the image out of the frame instead.npm


Notes to self. oh I can see clearly now. The services is mobile friendly as it changes to website to display products from a mobile view.
The dropdown bar is already mobile friendly. from what I can see of it.
