## NOTE FOR ASHBY HIMSELF

1. What I need to do is I need to redirect all of the portfolio descriptions away from the their own portfolio page and onto home 

2. Add two seperate background patterns to the site one for the headers. side and footer (hotel wallpaper black). and another white for the main content (ripples).




## The link for the layout for home page is right here

<!-- I would like to build up the CV component of the site. -->


# DONT FORGET
### Run 'npm run build' do before deploy essential
### Run 'npm run deploy' to launch your project.

### The url for github pages can be found in the package.json file alongside homepage.



# To Do list for portfolio.
