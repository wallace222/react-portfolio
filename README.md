## NOTE FOR ASHBY HIMSELF


With what to do about my resume. 
There is an API for embedding pdf's onto the site. For now what I should try and do is embed a pdf of my resume.
so that if I update my resume I can quickly update it onto my site.

<!-- Important thing that needs to be noted. -->

<!--

 the next project that I decide to build make sure that it is available on the net so that it can be referenced easily. 

-->





2. Add two seperate background patterns to the site one for the headers. side and footer (hotel wallpaper black). and another white for the main content (ripples).




## The link for the layout for home page is right here
