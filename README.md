## NOTE FOR ASHBY HIMSELF

1. For the top two portfolios I will try by seperating them.
2. then I will size the text section and the image section of both areas.




2. Add two seperate background patterns to the site one for the headers. side and footer (hotel wallpaper black). and another white for the main content (ripples).




## The link for the layout for home page is right here

<!-- I would like to build up the CV component of the site. -->
