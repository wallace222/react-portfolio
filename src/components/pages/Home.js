                <h3>Story</h3>

                <p>
                    I am a passionate software developer currently living in the Auckland region.

                    I would like to thank my father who was the one who introduced me to the tech world.
                    
                    Through the scripting language python.

                    Which projects I had built over this time included such things as multi choice adventures and climaxed
                    with an amazing card game script of black jack. With a everything to user input and all the conditionals to get a working dealer.
                    It was fun but it was not enough to progress my skills.

                    After that I saught further mentorship. So I left my job to attend a bootcamp.

                    My bootcamp of choice was 'Enspiral Dev Academy'. Which I am pretty hard to be convinced was the most fun I have had building projects,
                    Especially working with the other students.

                    Now that my time at the bootcamp is over, I have my sights on producing polished, refined projects in the field of tech.

                <h3>To any Fellow travelers</h3>

                <p>
                    I am always looking to collaborate with new and interesting people who share an interest in technology.
                    If anyone would like for me to contribute to any projects or contribute to any of my projects.
                    My socials are open and I don't bite. 
                </p>
