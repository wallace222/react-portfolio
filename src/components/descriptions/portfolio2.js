            "IMPORTANT NOTE: although I know that this project related to lifestyle choice's. I am in no way telling anyone how to live their life, only you know what is best for you.",
            "This is my final project that I had made while I was studying at enspiral dev academy.",
            "The time span that the instructors had given me to present the project was 10 days.",
            "which included weekday's and weekend's, oh which I had taken the opportunity of those day's to get extra work done on my project",
            "I had worked on this project by myself at this point in time.",
            "although because I was working inside of the cohort, I was constantly peeking my head to look at other people's project's.",
            "giving help to other's when needed and offering my helping hand.",
            "I believe that I was constantly in the process of exchanging idea's between other's developer's in the process of my project,",
            "essentially to say that I was solely working on my project would be a lie"
        ],
        purpose: [
            "The purpose of health hub is to be a website that offers health advice based off of my own personal research into health science.",
            "I by no means have a background in medicine from formal education or as a career. but I am hoping, that if",
            "Health has always been something that I have alwasy been intensly interested in and I would almost like to use",
            "the website as a diary of sorts so that I am able to access and of my notes and resources that I have deamed useful",
            "at the skip of a heart beat."
        ],
        NotesOnCreationProcess: [
            "While making the website the first freature that was on my mind was a feature for calculating",
            "on how long it would take the user to reach their desired health goal",
            "in the mean time what I had created was a calorie calculator, As for now I thought that would provide",
            "a solid bit of functionality rather than have my page remain as a gorified health blog.",
        ],
        plannedFeatures: [
           "I have alot of planned features, some of which I would like to expand on the calculator and new functions",
           "for the calculator, I would like to make it alot more dynamic, I would like to help guide the user into figuring out",
           "what their resting maintainence calories are in the most unintrusive way possible",
           "I would like to checklist's of things that are inside of the user's schedule that would burn calorie's",
            "which would include everything to the typical exercise all the way to being exposed to cold temperatures and psychological stress.",
            "I had lots of plans of adding more calculator functionality, from macro recommendations and suggestions based off lifestyle. And further down the road nutritional tracking information based on ingredients consumed in food.",
            "I could really go hard on this project, I could easily go into more finetuned details with tracking sun exposure with vitamin d",
            "tracking water consumption throughout the day. As a lifestyle and health tracking app their is really no end to what I could track",
            "the list could go endlessly, which was the original goal.",
            "I even had big plans of suggesting non-medicinal/ non-surgical physical therapies to certain physical condition's. take with a gain of salt.",
            "I am not telling people how to live their lives by any means only you know what is best for you. ",
